    <p>We also employ any external service providers to provide our services, this is done in 
        accordance with the stipulations of § 28 GDPR. We have concluded a limited-processing 
        contract with each data processing company to ensure that your personal data are processed 
        according to their purpose and not shared. We also take appropriate technical and 
        organisational measures to protect your personal data.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>C2 Digital, Harare, Zimbabwe: Website maintenance and development</li>
        <li>Zimbabwe Farmers Union, 5 Van Praagh Avenue, Milton Park.Harare</li>

        <li>Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA: Website 
            analysis and remarketing</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>Insofar as contents, tools, or other materials are employed within the framework of this 
        Privacy Notice by other providers (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Third-Party 
        Providers”) registered in a third country, it must be assumed that data are being transferred
        to the Third-Party Provider&#39;s country of record. Third countries are countries in 
        which the GDPR is not directly-applicable law—categorically, this includes countries 
        outside of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Data may be transferred 
        into third countries in the presence of the appropriate data protection level, user 
        consent, or another form of statutory authorisation.</p>
    
    <p>Where the law requires it, for example during a criminal investigation we will be obliged 
        to turn over information that may include personal information to the investigating 
        entities once we are reasonably satisfied that they have the lawful permission to access 
        such information.</p>
    
    <h2>6. How do we store and protect your personal data?</h2>
    
    <p>We are committed to protecting your personal data once we have it. We implement physical, 
        business, and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security
        breach, we will notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
    
    <p>We also do not want your personal data for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it 
        long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we do not need it, we take steps to 
        destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer. Personal data from deactivated 
        accounts is archived for six years in terms of the Postal and Telecommunications Act of 
        Zimbabwe; it is permanently erased from our servers at the lapse of that six-year period.</p>
    
    <p>The data that we store are deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended
        purpose and erasure does not violate any statutory retention periods. Insofar as user data
        are not deleted because they are required for other legal purposes, the processing of the 
        same is restricted. This means that the data are segregated and not processed for other 
        purposes. This applies, for example, to user data that need to be stored for commercial or 
        tax purposes.</p>
    
    <p>In accordance with statutory regulations, data pursuant to § 257.1 HGB (German Commercial 
        Code) must be retained for six years (annual financial statements, vouchers etc.), and 
        data pursuant to § 147.1 AO (German Revenue Code) must be retained for ten years (books, 
        records, management reports, vouchers, documentation relevant to taxation etc.).</p>
    
    <p><i>AgriShare</i> may keep non-personal and anonymised data for longer periods for reporting 
        purposes and in situations where laws make it necessary to keep such data.</p>
    
    <p>We store your data on servers located in Zimbabwe, additionally this data is backed up to 
        servers in Frankfurt, Germany. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of 
        transfer of your data. We comply with applicable law and will also abide by the 
        commitments we make in this privacy notice.</p>
    
    <h2>7. What are your rights?</h2>
    
    <p>Upon request and authentication, we are happy to inform you in writing and in accordance 
        with the applicable law if personal data concerning yourself have been processed. If this
        is the case, you are entitled to the disclosure of these personal data and of the 
        information listed in detail in § 15 GDPR.</p>
    
    <p>Should the personal data concerning yourself be incorrect, you have the right to immediately 
        demand the rectification of inaccurate personal data or the completion of incomplete 
        personal data (§ 16 GDPR).</p>
    
    <p>You have the right to demand that personal data concerning yourself be immediately deleted 
        insofar as one of the particular reasons listed in § 17 GDPR applies, for example if the 
        data are no longer required for their intended purpose (right to erasure).</p>
    
    <p>You also have the right to demand the restriction of processing if one of the prerequisites 
        listed in § 18 GDPR applies; for example, if you have objected to processing, this will
        apply for the duration of examination by the controller.</p>
    
    <p>You have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning 
        yourself for reasons arising from your particular situation. Our company will then cease 
        to process said personal data unless we can prove compelling grounds for the processing or 
        the processing serves to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims (§ 21 GDPR).</p>
    
    <p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to
        file a complaint with the supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of 
        personal data concerning yourself infringes the GDPR (§ 77 GDPR). You may exercise this 
        right through a supervisory authority in the member state of your place of residence, of 
        your place of employment, or of the place in which the alleged infraction occurred. In 
        North Rhine– Westphalia, the following person has jurisdiction:</p>
