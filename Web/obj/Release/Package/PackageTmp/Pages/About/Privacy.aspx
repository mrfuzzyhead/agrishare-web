    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains generally how AgriShare services receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it. This is in fulfilment of our commitment to being transparent and open.</p>

    <p><small>DEFINITIONS</small></p>

    <h3>What is your “personal information?”</h3>
    <p>For us, “personal information” means information that identifies you, like your name or email address.<br />
        Any information that falls outside of this definition is “non-personal information.”</p>

    <h3>How do we learn information about you?</h3>
    <p>We learn information about you when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you create an account or input your location);</li>
        <li>we collect it automatically through our mobile phone Application (e.g., when the AgriShare Application on your phone connects with our servers for updates, or in download statistics provided by Google Play). Data may be collected when you search for listings, add listings, send and receive notifications and when you make a booking for services and goods listed in the App; and</li>
        <li>when you add your Ecocash account information (we will only know your Ecocash number and the transactions you carry out on the AgriShare service)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What do we do with your information once we have it?</h3>
    <p>Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our software and services for you. Your information also helps us connect you to service providers. Non-personal information may be included in Agrishare performance reports, and for Agrishare’s promotional purposes.</p>

    <h3>When do we share your information with others?</h3>
    <p>We do not share your information with any third parties. But where the law requires it, for example during a criminal investigation we will be obliged to turn over information that may include personal information to the investigating entities once we are certain that they have the lawful permission to access such information.</p>

    <h3>How do we store and protect your personal information?</h3>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business, and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we will notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
    <p>We also do not want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we do not need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer. Personal information from deactivated accounts is archived for one calendar year; it is permanently erased from our servers at the lapse of the one-year period.</p>
    <p>Agrishare may keep non-personal and depersonalised information for longer periods for reporting purposes and in situations where laws make it necessary to keep such information. </p>

    <h3>What else should you know?</h3>
    <p>We store your information on servers located in Zimbabwe, additionally this information is backed up to servers in Frankfurt, Germany. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. We comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>We do not allow children under the age of 18 years to register on the Agrishare service. If you are under 18 years of age we do not want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 18 years of age has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your child’s information removed.</p>
    <p>You may at any time request for a copy of all the information that we have about you. This allows you to check such information for accuracy and where necessary help us correct any inaccurate information we might have on you. We will respond to information requests within a reasonable amount of time that will not exceed 7 business days.</p>
    
    <h3>What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?</h3>
    <p>We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p>
